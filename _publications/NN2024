Vehicular edge computing (VEC), a promising paradigm for the development of emerging intelligent transportation systems, can provide lower service latency for vehicular applications. However, it is still a challenge to fulfill the requirements of such applications with stringent latency requirements in the VEC system with limited resources. In addition, existing methods focus on handling the offloading task in a certain time slot with statically allocated resources, but ignore the heterogeneous tasksâ€™ different resource requirements, resulting in resource wastage. To solve the real-time task offloading and heterogeneous resource allocation problem in VEC system, we propose a decentralized solution based on the attention mechanism and recurrent neural networks (RNN) with a multi-agent distributed deep deterministic policy gradient (AR-MAD4PG). First, to address the partial observability of agents, we construct a shared agent graph and propose a periodic communication mechanism that enables edge nodes to aggregate information from other edge nodes. Second, to help agents better understand the current system state, we design an RNN-based feature extraction network to capture the historical state and resource allocation information of the VEC system. Thirdly, to tackle the challenges of excessive joint observation-action space and ineffective information interference, we adopt the multi-head attention mechanism to compress the dimension of the observation-action space of agents. Finally, we build a simulation model based on the actual vehicle trajectories, and the experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the existing approaches.
